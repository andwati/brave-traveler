App components are the essential building blocks of an Android app. Each component is an entry point through which the system or a user can enter your app. Some components depend on others.

There are four types of app components:

- [Activities](Activity.md)
- [Services](Service.md)
- [Broadcast receivers](Broadcast%20Receiver.md)
- [Content providers](Content%20Provider.md)
Each type serves a distinct purpose and has a distinct lifecycle that defines how a component is created and destroyed.
