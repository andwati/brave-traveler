[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) was born from JetBrains. It was initially designed for the [JVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine) environment and combines functional and object-oriented programming. Since its release, Kotlin has become a rising star in Android development and other fields.

Here are a few reasons why Kotlin pairs so well with Android:

- **Interoperability**: Kotlin is 100% interoperable with Java and supports great interoperability with JVM environments.
- **Safety**: Android apps that contain Kotlin code are 20% less likely to crash according to [the Android docs](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/first).
- **Asynchronicity**: Kotlin’s use of [coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) allows it to provide asynchronous (non-blocking) programming support.

In addition to the points above, Google announced their [Kotlin-first approach to Android development](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/first) at Google I/O 2019. Since the announcement, the number of applications built with Kotlin has increased exponentially.
