 -  **Android's Process Model (Linux Kernel Foundation):** Android leverages the Linux kernel's process management capabilities. Processes are created, managed, and terminated by the Android system. The kernel prioritizes foreground processes (apps you're actively using) to ensure a smooth user experience. Background processes are throttled to conserve resources like battery.
    
- **App Lifecycle and Background Execution:** Power users often seek ways to optimize background process behavior. Android provides an app lifecycle model, allowing apps to handle different states (foreground, background, destroyed). Developers can implement services to run specific tasks in the background, but the system may restrict them to conserve resources. Tools like `adb shell` (Android Debug Bridge) can be used for advanced process monitoring, though rooting the device might be necessary for deeper control (not recommended for security reasons).
