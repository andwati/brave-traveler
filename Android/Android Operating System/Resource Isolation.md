**Android Resource Management:** Resource isolation is a cornerstone of Android's security model. The system enforces isolation between apps using techniques like:

- [ **Linux Users and Groups:**](Multi%20User%20Linux.md) Each app runs under a unique Linux user ID (UID) and group ID (GID), restricting access to system resources and preventing apps from interfering with each other.

- **Sandboxing:** Apps are confined to their own sandboxed environments, limiting their ability to access other apps' data or system resources.
